		<p>Welcome to deadontheinside.github.io. It's a website. With bands. And cool music. And stuff.</p>

		<p>My name is Nathan. Iâ€™m very into music. Particularly heavy music such as screamo, metalcore, deathcore, hardcore, post-hardcore, electronicore.</p>
		<p>I also enjoy normal metal, hard rock, emo, punk, and alternative rock.</p>
		<p>This site is a place for me to dump all my otherwise useless and pointless band knowledge and just talk about new music coming out.</p>
		<p>Enjoy.</p>
