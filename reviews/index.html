	<h4>Asking Alexandria - The Black (March 25, 2016).</h4>
	
		<p>By far the best albums this band has ever released, mainly due to their new singer, Denis Shaforostov (formerly Down & Dirty, Make Me Famous) and his melodic singing voice as well as crushing gutturals and eardrum-tearing highs.</p>
		<p>Overall this album was amazing, every song was great. A few songs could have been done better but the perfect singles released easily more than make up for that.</p>
		<p>The guitar in these songs is amazing as well, showing off their wonderful guitarists’ skills.</p>
		<p>All the way from a steel guitar in I Won’t Give In to bone-crushing breakdowns in Let It Sleep.</p>
		<p>The lyrics, co-written by Denis and the guitarist Ben Bruce, were beautiful on every last track, ranging from stadium anthems to hatred-filled fist-pumpers and lighter-waving ballads.</p>
	
	<h4><em>9.1/10</em></h4>
	
	<h4>Favourite track: <em>I Won't Give In</em></h4>

	<h4>The Amity Affliction - Chasing Ghosts (September 7, 2015).</h4>
		
		<p>The most amazing of all four of the band’s albums, although not by much.</p>
		<p>The steady guitar rhythms interspersed with breakdowns, the clean singer/bass player’s, Ahren Stringer, amazing voice, and Joel Birch’s growls make this an album that every last metalcore fan should hear and love.</p>
		<p>I would advise any listeners to listen once to each song in a row through the whole album and then listen to each while scrolling through the lyrics, probably a few times for each song.</p>
		<p>You can never get tired of these absolute masterpieces so by all means have it on repeat for the next few weeks.</p>
