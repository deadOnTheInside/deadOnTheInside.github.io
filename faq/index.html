		<p><em>Q:</em> Why do you listen to what you do?</p>
			<p><em>A:</em> The simple answer? Because I love everything about it.</p>
			<p>The long answer? I love all of the talent required to make it, the effort everyone in the bands put in.</p>
			<p>I love all the instrumental parts, how they require skill to play, unlike most popular music today, and just the amazing sound people can get out of a guitar or three.</p>
			<p>The solos and/or breakdowns generally involved in the music I like make it more complicated, with more than just verses, choruses, and a bridge.</p>
			<p>Also, the lyrical content.</p>
			<p>Most of the songs I listen to tell a story, often a very personal one to the band member(s) who wrote it.</p>
			<p>I love the meanings behind every word they sing (or scream).</p>
			<p>As well, the singers and screamers require talent as I refuse to listen to any talentless person who uses auto-tune.</p>

		<p><em>Q:</em> How can you stand all the screaming?</p>
			<p><em>A:</em> At first, I hated it. I thought the same thing.</p>
			<p>But the more I listened and the more lyrics I read so I could understand what they were saying the more I liked it.</p>
			<p>It’s just a different kind of singing. Like putting distortion on a guitar.</p>
			<p>Except for the fact that it requires a ton of talent.</p>
			<p>I love the screaming because you can’t auto-tune a scream, and they just sound so much better when left unedited.</p>
			<p>The voice cracks, popping vocal chords, those little imperfections that let you know that there is indeed a very talented human on the other end.</p>
